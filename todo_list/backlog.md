# REDDSTUDIO Backlog

Raw ideas and feature requests. Pick one → refine into `ready/` → implement.

## UI/UX

### Homepage Simplification
Make home page look like reference: `C:\Users\Rober\Downloads\Screenshot 2026-02-04 194511.jpg`
Minimal settings visible, advanced sleek button to open all forms. Only show preview after first generation so it looks sleek. Use shadcn components.

---

## Auth/Onboarding

### Supabase Email Branding
Email registration looks bad - sends to random localhost URL. Make it come from our domain, not theirs. Currently looks generic.

---

## Generation UX

### Loading Animation Improvement
Improve the loading of generations. Research unique loading bars from genius brands/products for inspiration.
