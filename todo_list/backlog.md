## UI/UX

### A+ Preview Integration
On preview, the A+ modules are completely apart from the listing preview module - they should be in same wrapper so they look more like Amazon. They also have headers for A+ with category of style module, but that's not what happens on Amazon - they're continuous. Move that category (hero image, lifestyle, etc) to something that shows on mouse hover along with buttons.

### Homepage Simplification
Make home page look like reference: `C:\Users\Rober\Downloads\Screenshot 2026-02-04 194511.jpg`
Minimal settings visible, advanced sleek button to open all forms. Only show preview after first generation so it looks sleek. Use shadcn components.

### Profile Dropdown
Add profile small icon top right with: Plans & Pricing, Settings, Join Community (Discord TBD), Log out. Underneath show "X% daily compute used".

## Auth/Onboarding

### Supabase Email Branding
Email registration looks bad - sends to random localhost URL. Make it come from our domain, not theirs. Currently looks generic.

---

## Generation UX

### Loading Animation Improvement
Improve the loading of generations. Research unique loading bars from genius brands/products for inspiration.

### Out of Credits Widget
Add out of credits widget popup - currently a silent error. Link to upgrade subscription.

---

## Completed (move stories here for reference)

- Style reference toggle default ON + no credits when skipping preview
