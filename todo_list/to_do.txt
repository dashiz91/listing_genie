                              RAW IDEAS (your scratchpad)
================================================================================
Dump anything here messily - I'll curate it below when you ask me to clean up.

[
lets make sure we tackle all of these:
These are just 5 images this tool generates, right? Based on one input image? Does it at least pull the URL/ASIN to get info about the product?

It doesn’t help me with the headache of actually setting it up in admin?

It doesn’t help me with Mobile in parallel?

It doesn’t help me with adding alt text?

It doesn’t help me with other types of sections?

It doesn’t generate images in a way that they “stitch together”

To me it just looks like a random assortment of 5 AI generated images on the topic of a product, without any strategy or structure behind it. I wouldn’t be your customer.

So many tools like this popping up these days, like selluna.ai or listingoptimization.ai - this capability isn’t new. You need to tell me what your tool does better than the big number of other AI wrappers out there already

having some pre generated styles for usrs to just choose it, that wont require credits, and ppl can just browse for styles they may like. here we could have different categories like seasonal [xmas,vlentine, moms day etc], simplitic,modern,luxury, idk multi more styles, for this one we could generate the images to have em as fixed assets for all, we cna use gemini mcp to generate those styles ok?

fix sending to https://staging.reddstudio.ai/auth wihch is just blank, on sign out that hapens and other stuff i think
fix edit attachjments not being appeneded to gens or edits
remove pricing when we select model as thats cost, also we may need a better way to choose that? easier to seee?

Connect it to seller central to push lisitng and +A single image only modulesare
