                              RAW IDEAS (your scratchpad)
================================================================================
Dump anything here messily - I'll curate it below when you ask me to clean up.

[
lets make sure we tackle all of these:
These are just 5 images this tool generates, right? Based on one input image? Does it at least pull the URL/ASIN to get info about the product?

It doesn’t help me with the headache of actually setting it up in admin?

It doesn’t help me with Mobile in parallel?

It doesn’t help me with adding alt text?

It doesn’t help me with other types of sections?

It doesn’t generate images in a way that they “stitch together”

To me it just looks like a random assortment of 5 AI generated images on the topic of a product, without any strategy or structure behind it. I wouldn’t be your customer.

So many tools like this popping up these days, like selluna.ai or listingoptimization.ai - this capability isn’t new. You need to tell me what your tool does better than the big number of other AI wrappers out there already

Connect it to seller central to push lisitng and +A single image only modules

make it so import doesnt get affected by captcha trigger or a smarter wayto get the scrapping neede (a retry with backoff for no trigger captcha?idk u try some stuff please, customer no friction)]

make editing existing project more obvious on ui
have import automatically retry if captcha, user shoud click only ONCE ever.
