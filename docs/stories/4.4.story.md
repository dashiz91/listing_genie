**Status:** Draft

---

## User Story

As a user, I want my images optimized for where shoppers look first so that key elements capture attention immediately.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Prompts include composition guidance based on eye-tracking heatmap data:
  - Primary focus zone: center-left for main product
  - Secondary zone: top-right for key benefit text
  - F-pattern reading flow for infographics
  - Mobile-first: larger elements, higher contrast
- [ ] Key selling points positioned in high-attention areas
- [ ] Text overlays placed in optimal reading zones
- [ ] Product positioned to maximize visual weight
- [ ] Negative space used strategically to direct attention

## Technical Notes

### Heatmap Composition Reference
From `docs/creative-blueprint.md` Section 5:

```
+-------------------------------+
| #### HIGH ATTENTION ZONE #### | <- Key benefit text
|                               |
|     +-----------------+       |
|     |                 |       |
|     |     PRODUCT     | <- Center-left focus
|     |    (Primary)    |
|     |                 |       |
|     +-----------------+       |
|                               |
|  Supporting info / proof      | <- F-pattern reading
+-------------------------------+
```

### Composition Rules
| Zone | Content | Priority |
|------|---------|----------|
| Center-Left | Main product | Primary attention |
| Top-Right | Key benefit text | Secondary attention |
| Bottom | Supporting points | F-pattern flow |

### Mobile-First Considerations
- Larger text elements for small screens
- Higher contrast for visibility
- Simplified compositions
- Touch-friendly spacing

### Prompt Integration
Add to each template:

```
[COMPOSITION OPTIMIZATION]
- Place product in center-left zone for maximum attention
- Position key message in top-right high-attention area
- Follow F-pattern for supporting information
- Use negative space to direct eye flow
- Mobile-first: ensure readability at small sizes
```
