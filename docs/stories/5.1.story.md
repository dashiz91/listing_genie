## User Story

As a developer, I need a FastAPI backend set up so that the frontend can interact with APIs for all features.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] FastAPI application with proper project structure
- [ ] Environment variable configuration (.env support)
- [ ] CORS configured for frontend origin
- [ ] Health check endpoint (/health)
- [ ] Error handling middleware
- [ ] Request logging middleware
- [ ] API documentation via Swagger UI (/docs)

## Technical Notes

### Project Structure Reference
See `docs/architecture.md` Section 2.1 for complete project structure.

Key directories:
```
app/
|-- main.py                    # FastAPI application entry point
|-- config.py                  # Configuration and environment variables
|-- dependencies.py            # Dependency injection
|-- api/
|   |-- router.py              # Main API router
|   |-- endpoints/
|       |-- health.py          # Health check endpoints

|   |-- logging.py             # Logging configuration
|   |-- middleware.py          # Request logging, error handling
```

### Configuration Reference
See `docs/architecture.md` Section 7.2 for environment variables.

### Health Check Endpoints
- `GET /health` - Basic health check
- `GET /api/health` - Detailed health with dependency status
