**Story ID:** 1.3
**Title:** Validate Inputs Before Generation
**Priority:** Must Have
**Complexity:** Small

## User Story

As a user, I want to see clear error messages if my inputs are invalid so that I can correct them before generating images.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] System validates all inputs before enabling generate button
- [ ] Image validation includes format, size, and dimensions
- [ ] Text validation includes required fields and character limits
- [ ] Error messages are specific and actionable
- [ ] Errors display inline near the relevant field
- [ ] User cannot proceed to generation with validation errors
- [ ] Valid form displays visual confirmation (green checkmarks)
